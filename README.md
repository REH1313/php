# PHP Forms Assignment

This assignment shows a basic e-commerce pricing tool using PHP and Bootstrap. It includes form.php and handle-form.php that calculates the total cost based on the users input. 

Here is a list of what I did:
-Created form.php with a valid HTML5 structure and Bootstrap styling
-Defined a PHP associative array to dynamically generate album options
-Used Bootstrap classes (form-control, form-select, form-check, btn) for consistent styling
-Displayed a styled summary card with Userâ€™s name, Album title, Quantity and format

I did copy and pasted my code to Copilot to see if I had any errors.
Copilot was able to catch some typos I had made. One of my mistakes it was able to catch was that I had written "hmtl" instead of "html" which could've messed up the entire code.
