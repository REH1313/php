# Date and Time
This assignment shows a dynamic calendar.
Users see the current date and time and are able to change/update the date and time as well.
The website also displays the image and greeting message base on the time of day.
The website displays the image and seasonal message based on the current semester. 
The website displays the number of days until Christmas.
My code uses template.php for layout and is styled with Bootstrap.
I used Copilot AI to assist me in checking for typos as well as explain to me why I couldn't see the images in the website. It turned out that the images had to also be uploaded to the Filezilla on php in the folder images. And when I did that, the images appeared.
