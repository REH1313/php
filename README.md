# php

This project includes the welcome message and the short personal introduction.
After that I included a creativity quote. I heard it from somewhere once but do not know who it is from.
The next php variables were defined for CodeStream Solutions' address. They are concatenated into a fromatted block and then displayed.
I assigned two variables to numbers 15 and 4 and performed addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus.
I defined my name with a constant and displayed it.
One of the sources I used to help me was w3schools.com under the PHP Examples. I looked into the one that said PHP Variables, 'Create different variables'.
