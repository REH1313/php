# PHP Arrays Assignment

This PHP script models structured music data using associative and multidimensional arrays. It shows album ratings, artists and filters albums by release year using loops and conditionals. 

Here is a list of what I did:
-Associative array of 5 albums with ratings
-Sorted album list displayed using foreach
-Multidimensional array of 4 artists with albums and years
-Loops to display full library and The Whoâ€™s discography
-Conditional filtering for albums released after 1970
-All output stored in "$pageContent" and echoed to browser

I did copy and pasted my code to Copilot to see if I had any errors.
Copilot was able to catch some typos I had made. It also corrected a mistake I had throughout my entire code. It noticed that I was overwriting $pageContent instead of appending to it. 
So instead of having "$pageContent =", I was supposed to have 
"$pageContent .=".

I also ended up using AI to help me find the link to the website since I keep struggling with folders and files and where things belong.
