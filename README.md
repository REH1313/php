# Page Templating

This assignment shows a multi-page PHP application that simulates a professional invoicing workflow for a fictional client. Its built using server-side includes, custom functions, and Bootstrap styling. 

Here is a list of what I did:
-Created template.php with $pageTitle; bootstrap styling and HTML, output buffering with $pageContents
-Built functions.php; defined priceCalc()
-Created invoice.php with the albums, format and quantity fields
-Built handle-invoice.php and included fallback error messaging and navigation
-Included personalized albums based off an aesthetic

I used Copilot to see if I had any errors once again.
Copilot was able to catch some of the errors I had made in my code. Some of them being that I didnt include closing tags where I should have.
