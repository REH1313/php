# Form Validation

This project allows users to enter their name, email, favorite instrument, favorite animals and favorite activity.
When the submit button is clicked, the user is taken to a 'summary' page that outputs the information they entered.
An array is shown at the bottom displaying the name, email, instrument, animals and activity based on the user input.
The form is styled with Bootstrap, wrapped in template.php and print_r($_POST) appears after submission.
htmlspecialchars(), trim(), and filter_var() are used correctly.
Bootstrap alerts (alert alert-danger) show feedback.
AI Copilot was used to check for typos in code and to expand on Bootstrap alert alert-danger.
